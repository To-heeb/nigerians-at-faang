Her first experience with a computer was at a cyber caf\u00e9 where she used N200 to spend thirty minutes online \u2014 just enough time to Google &#039;how to build a website&#039;. That small moment sparked a fire in her. With no personal computer at home, Ada spent her evenings at internet caf\u00e9s watching YouTube tutorials and reading articles on W3Schools. Her interest in coding grew, but so did the challenges. Slow internet, frequent blackouts, and limited mentorship made learning difficult. But she pushed through \u2014 every obstacle became part of her story. While studying Computer Science at the University of Lagos, Ada co-founded a campus tech club. She taught others what she had learned and organized small hackathons. It was at one of these events she met a visiting software engineer from the UK, who encouraged her to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Ada started contributing to open-source, despite her impostor syndrome. She built small tools, fixed documentation bugs, and eventually landed a remote internship with a U.S.-based startup. That experience taught her how teams in Silicon Valley worked \u2014 the collaboration, code reviews, and fast-paced environment were unlike anything she had seen. She applied to the Google Africa Developer Scholarship and made the most of the mentorship and learning tracks. With each step, she improved her technical skills and expanded her network. After graduating, she set her sights on Google. The application process was grueling. Multiple interviews, weeks of prep, and more than a few moments of self-doubt. But in the end, she got the call: \u201cWe\u2019d like to offer you a position as a Software Engineer at Google.\u201d Now based in Mountain View, California, Ada works on Google Search and volunteers with organizations that support women in tech. She\u2019s a mentor, a role model, and a powerful example that it is possible \u2014 with grit, curiosity, and support \u2014 to go from a cyber caf\u00e9 in Lagos to the Googleplex in Silicon Valley. Her advice? &#039;Don\u2019t wait to be ready. Start now. Stay hungry. Help others along the way.&#039;&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;blog-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:null,&quot;views_count&quot;:0,&quot;profile_id&quot;:1,&quot;is_published&quot;:1,&quot;published_at&quot;:&quot;2025-06-10T16:55:37.000000Z&quot;,&quot;is_featured&quot;:0,&quot;featured_at&quot;:null,&quot;last_featured_at&quot;:null,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2025-06-10T16:55:37.000000Z&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2025-06-10T16:55:37.000000Z&quot;}</loc>
